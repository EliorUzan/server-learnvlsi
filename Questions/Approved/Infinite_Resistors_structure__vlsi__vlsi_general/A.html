    <p>In order to solve this, we will first try solving one branch at a time,
         assuming we are not dealing with an infinite structure of resistors</p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>First, we take care of the first 3 resistors sub-circuit. In this simple case, we have only 3 resistors in series, thus 3R</li>
        <li>Second, We will take care of 2 branches put together, where the right set of 3 resistors can be treated as the first step. Then, get the equivalent resistance of the outer branch. 
            Lastly, we will connect the remaining resistors in parallel to get the total equivalent resistance. See below images.
        <li>Now, by the same logic, we can replace the right (outer) branch of resistors with the R_infinite resistance. The one we aim to find and repeat the process of the previous step.
            Note that the total equivalent resistance will be equal to R_infinite - We got an equation we can now go on and solve.</li>
