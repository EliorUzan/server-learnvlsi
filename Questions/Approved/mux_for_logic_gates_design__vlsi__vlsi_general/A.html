<p>In order to solve this, it is best to focus on one input and take into account its sole impact on the output
    <ul>
        <li>NOT Gate - For A=0, the value one will be picked in the mux, for A=1, the value 0 will be picked in the mux. therfore - a NOT gate</li>
        <li>AND Gate - For A=0, B has no impect on the output, it will be 0 anyway. for A=1, the output will be equal to B.</li>
        <li>OR Gate - For A=0, The output will be equal to B. For A=1, the output will be 1 (independent of B)</li>
    </ul>
